# 7-6 Runtime Config and App Config

*In this lesson, we look at the two different ways we can supply configuration values to our app.*

*While both are reactive while the app is running, only the Runtime config can be updated after the app is built. This is useful for things that change between environments, like using different databases in your testing and staging and production environments.*

*App config canâ€™t be set after build time, but it supports TypeScript fully, and can be changed on a per request basis. This lets us do things like change the app theme for every request that comes in, based on user preference.*

Runtime Config:
- defined in *nuxt.config.ts* with `runtimeConfig` key
- reactive
- specified after build (built once, run on many servers and envs)
- secrets, tokens and other evnironment variables
- Supabase keys, Prisma keys (under the hood)
- Stripe keys

App Config:
- defined in `app.config.ts`
- reactive
- specified at build time
- project config, theme, anything not sensitive, change per request
- full TypeScript support
- dark mode vs light mode (toggle with value sent with each request)
